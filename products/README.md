The folders inside this folder will contain all the products of your project.

Currently, the only material for the project is located here
/manuscript/Manuscript.qmd
/manuscript/Manuscript.docx
and
/manuscript/images

The Manuscript.qmd is the source file for the manuscript document. It is written in markdown and can be rendered to a word document using pandoc.

When the Manuscript.qmd is rendered it will update the Manuscript.docx. If you have issues rendering the document, please ensure you have all the packages installed and loaded.
